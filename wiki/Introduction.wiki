PyPSO was developed to be a generic complete particle swarm optimization framework written in pure python, the main goals of PyPSO are:

  * Written in pure python, to maximize the cross-platform issue;
  * Easy to use API, the API must be easy for end-user
  * See the evolution, the user can see and interact with the evolution statistics, graphs and etc;
  * Extensible, the API is extensible, the user can create new representations, swarm operators like communicator, topologies and etc.
  * Fast, the design must be optimized for peformance
  * Common features, the framework must implement the common features: topologies like global topology, local topologies. Communicators schemes like Global Communicators, etc.
 * Default - parameters, we must have default operators, settings, etc. in all options
 * Open-source, the source is for everyone, not for only one.
